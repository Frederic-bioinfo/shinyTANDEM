shinyTANDEM provides a GUI for visualizing rTANDEM or x!tandem results. 

It should be noted that the results are fully loaded into memory and are 
constantly mined for data. That makes shinyTANDEM appropriate only for
datasets or moderate size. Even for datasets of appropriate
size, loading the dataset will likely take some time, and the browser 
might remain less responsive than it would be while simply browsing the web.
